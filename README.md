## <div id="introduction"> Introduction </div> 
A **Graphical User Interface** in a Java application provides users with an easy-to-use visual experience. It is made of graphical components which simplify user interaction. **Swing** is a toolkit in Java that includes GUI Components. Swing provides a rich set of widgets and packages to make sophisticated GUI components for Java applications.

The Java Swing library has all the GUI components precoded and all components can be added to container classes. There are three types of Java Swing Containers

1. **Frame:** It is a fully functioning window with its title and icons.
1. **Panel:** It is a pure container but not a window. The purpose of a Panel is to organize the components onto a window.
1. **Dialog:** It serves as a pop-up window rather than a fully functioning window like the Frame.

## <div id="projectidea"> Project Idea </div>
The “Product Checkout System” is a simple Java GUI project that utilizes the Swing library to create a UI for users to enter a list of products with their prices and check them out on a File using the File Writer.

## <div id="projectdescription"> Project Description </div>
The “Product Checkout System” contains a single Java class, Main.java. The Main class has three methods

1. main(): The main method serves as the driver of the program. It is the first method to get executed in the program. The initialize method is called within it to run the program.

1. initialize(): The initialize method contains the GUI layout and startup conditions of the program. When the program starts the initialize method is called through the Main object and GUI objects are initialized along with the other objects.

1. actionPerformed(): The actionPerformed method is called when an event such as a button click is triggered. When a button is clicked the function identifies the source and acts accordingly.
