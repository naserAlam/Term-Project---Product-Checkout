##Set up project
	- gui
	- button functions
		- add button
		- checkout button
		- exit button

#15/01/2021 - 11:30 -> 14:32
##Investigation 
 1. ☑ (resolved) problem in FileWriter 
 2. ☑ (resolved) actionListener not added
 3. (ongoing) productList resets every time action called
		- ☑ (resolved) instantiated in actionPerformed()
		- (ongoing) instantiated in initialize()

#16/01/2021 - 12:54 -> 17:24
##Investigation
	3. ☑ (resolved) productList resets every time action called
		- ☑ (resolved) instantiated in initialize()

##[Report] Investigation
productList was instantiated at actionPerformed(), therefore it
resets everytime any button is clicked resulting it to be an
empty list. Thus the list was being not printed.

##Intended Updates
	- ☑ (resolved) Clear list after checkout
	- Take Product price with name
		- ☑ [done] Add another textfeild
		- ☑ [done] Add another List<String>
		- ☑ [done] Modify add button actionListener
		- ☑ [done] Modify checkout button actionListener
